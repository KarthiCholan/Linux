Differentiate Shell Scripting vs Python Scripting.



Use Shell Scripting When:

System Administration Tasks: Shell scripting is excellent for automating routine system administration tasks like managing files, directories, and processes.
 You can use shell scripts for tasks like starting/stopping services, managing users, and basic file manipulation.

Command Line Interactions: If your task primarily involves running command line tools and utilities, shell scripting can be more efficient. It's easy to call and 
control these utilities from a shell script.

Rapid Prototyping: If you need to quickly prototype a solution or perform one-off tasks, shell scripting is usually faster to write and execute. It's great for 
ad-hoc tasks.

Text Processing: Shell scripting is well-suited for tasks that involve text manipulation, such as parsing log files, searching and replacing text, or extracting 
data from text-based sources.

Environment Variables and Configuration: Shell scripts are useful for managing environment variables and configuring your system.



Use Python When:

Complex Logic: Python is a full-fledged programming language and is well-suited for tasks that involve complex logic, data structures, and algorithms. If your task
 requires extensive data manipulation, Python can be a more powerful choice.

Cross-Platform Compatibility: Python is more platform-independent than shell scripting, making it a better choice for tasks that need to run on different operating 
systems.

API Integration: Python has extensive libraries and modules for interacting with APIs, databases, and web services. If your task involves working with APIs, Python 
may be a better choice.

Reusable Code: If you plan to reuse your code or build larger applications, Python's structure and modularity make it easier to manage and maintain.

Error Handling: Python provides better error handling and debugging capabilities, which can be valuable in DevOps where reliability is crucial.



Advanced Data Processing: If your task involves advanced data processing, data analysis, or machine learning, Python's rich ecosystem of libraries 
(e.g., Pandas, NumPy, SciPy) makes it a more suitable choice.












Concatenation:


str1 = "Hello"
str2 = "World"
result = str1 + " " + str2
print(result)





Length:


text = "Python is awesome"
length = len(text)
print("Length of the string:", length)





LowerCase

text = "Python is awesome"
uppercase = text.upper()
lowercase = text.lower()
print("Uppercase:", uppercase)
print("Lowercase:", lowercase)




Replace:

text = "Python is awesome"
new_text = text.replace("awesome", "great")
print("Modified text:", new_text)









Split:


text = "Python is awesome"
words = text.split()
print("Words:", words)






Strip:


text = "   Some spaces around   "
stripped_text = text.strip()
print("Stripped text:", stripped_text)




Substring:

text = "Python is awesome"
substring = "is"
if substring in text:
    print(substring, "found in the text")








Regex
1. Regular Expressions for Text Processing:

Regular expressions (regex or regexp) are a powerful tool for pattern matching and text processing.
The re module in Python is used for working with regular expressions.
Common metacharacters: . (any character), * (zero or more), + (one or more), ? (zero or one), [] (character class), | (OR), ^ (start of a line),
 $ (end of a line), etc.









Search:



import re

text = "The quick brown fox"
pattern = r"brown"

search = re.search(pattern, text)
if search:
    print("Pattern found:", search.group())
else:
    print("Pattern not found")







Match:


import re

text = "The quick brown fox"
pattern = r"quick"

match = re.match(pattern, text)
if match:
    print("Match found:", match.group())
else:
    print("No match")






Difference between re.match() and re.search():
re.match(): Checks for a match only at the beginning of the string. If the pattern is found at the start, it returns a match object; otherwise, it returns None.

re.search(): Scans through the entire string and finds the first location where the pattern produces a match. It returns a match object if the pattern is found
 anywhere in the string; otherwise, it returns None.






Replace:



import re

text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy brown dog"
pattern = r"brown"

replacement = "red"

new_text = re.sub(pattern, replacement, text)
print("Modified text:", new_text)











SPlit:


import re

text = "apple,banana,orange,grape"
pattern = r","

split_result = re.split(pattern, text)
print("Split result:", split_result)



















Explain Function in python with realtime example


A function in Python is a block of code that performs a specific task. Functions are defined using the def keyword and can take inputs, called arguments.
 They are a way to encapsulate and reuse code.


def greet(name):
    """This function greets the user."""
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# Calling the function
greet("Alice")







Module:


A module is a Python script containing Python code. It can define functions, classes, and variables that can be used in other Python scripts.
 Modules help organize and modularize your code, making it more maintainable.

Example:

Suppose you have a Python file named my_module.py:

# my_module.py
def square(x):
    return x ** 2

pi = 3.14159265
You can use this module in another script:

import my_module

result = my_module.square(5)
print(result)
print(my_module.pi)
In this case, my_module is a Python module containing the square function and a variable pi.




Here are some of the commonly used modules for system administration in Python:

os Module:

Allows interaction with the operating system, including file operations, directory manipulation, and executing system commands.
python
Copy code
import os
subprocess Module:

Provides a way to spawn new processes, connect to their input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return codes.
python
Copy code
import subprocess
shutil Module:

Offers a higher-level interface for file operations, such as copying, moving, archiving, and more.
python
Copy code
import shutil
sys Module:

Provides access to some variables used or maintained by the Python interpreter, and functions that interact with the interpreter.
python
Copy code
import sys
platform Module:

Allows retrieving information about the platform, such as the operating system, version, and hardware architecture.
python
Copy code
import platform
socket Module:

Enables network communication and can be used for tasks like checking network connectivity or configuring network interfaces.
python
Copy code
import socket
paramiko Module:

A Python implementation of the SSH protocol, useful for remote administration tasks.
python
Copy code
import paramiko
psutil Module:

Provides an interface for retrieving information on running processes and system utilization (CPU, memory, disks, network, sensors).
python
Copy code
import psutil
logging Module:

Offers a flexible logging system that can be used for capturing and managing log messages related to system administration tasks.
python
Copy code
import logging
datetime Module:

Enables working with dates and times, which can be useful for tasks involving scheduling and logging.
python
Copy code
import datetime











Packages
A package is a collection of modules organized in directories. Packages help you organize related modules into a hierarchy. 
They contain a special file named __init__.py, which indicates that the directory should be treated as a package.

Example:

Suppose you have a package structure as follows:

my_package/
    __init__.py
    module1.py
    module2.py
You can use modules from this package as follows:

from my_package import module1

result = module1.function_from_module1()
In this example, my_package is a Python package containing modules module1 and module2.






2. How to Import a Package
Importing a package or module in Python is done using the import statement. You can import the entire package, specific modules, or individual functions/variables
 from a module.

Example:

# Import the entire module
import math

# Use functions/variables from the module
result = math.sqrt(16)
print(result)

# Import specific function/variable from a module
from math import pi
print(pi)
In this example, we import the math module and then use functions and variables from it. You can also import specific elements from modules using the from module
 import element syntax.









Difference between Module and Package

File Structure:

Modules are single Python files (module.py).
Packages are directories containing an __init__.py file along with multiple modules.
Organization:

Modules organize related code within a single file.
Packages help organize related modules within a directory structure.
Importing:

Modules are imported directly by their filename (import module).
Modules from a package are imported using the package name (from package import module).




my_project/
+-- main.py
+-- my_package/
   +-- __init__.py
   +-- module1.py
   +-- module2.py






The __init__.py file in a Python package can include:

Initialization Code: Code that runs when the package is imported.
Namespace Package Information: Details related to namespace package configuration.
Package-Level Variables: Variables for package-wide configuration or metadata.
Subpackage Importing: Control over what gets imported when the package is imported.
Version Information: Information about the package version.
Example:

python
Copy code
# Content of __init__.py

# Initialization code
print("Initializing my_package...")

# Package-level variable
package_variable = "This is a package variable"

# Version information
__version__ = "1.0"

# Explicitly define what should be imported when using 'from my_package import *'
__all__ = ['module1', 'module2']





Python Workspaces
Python workspaces refer to the environment in which you develop and run your Python code. They include the Python interpreter, installed libraries, and the
 current working directory. Understanding workspaces is essential for managing dependencies and code organization.

Python workspaces can be local or virtual environments. A local environment is the system-wide Python installation, while a virtual environment is an isolated
 environment for a specific project. You can create virtual environments using tools like virtualenv or venv.

Example:

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv myenv

# Activate the virtual environment (on Windows)
myenv\Scripts\activate

# Activate the virtual environment (on macOS/Linux)
source myenv/bin/activate
Once activated, you work in an isolated workspace with its Python interpreter and library dependencies.












Conditional Statements in Python
Conditional statements are a fundamental part of programming that allow you to make decisions and execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. 
In Python, you can use if, elif (short for "else if"), and else to create conditional statements.

if Statement
The if statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is True. If the condition is False, the code block is skipped.

if condition:
    # Code to execute if the condition is True
Example:
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")


elif Statement
The elif statement allows you to check additional conditions if the previous if or elif conditions are False. You can have multiple elif statements after the initial
 if statement.

if condition1:
    # Code to execute if condition1 is True
elif condition2:
    # Code to execute if condition2 is True
elif condition3:
    # Code to execute if condition3 is True
# ...
else:
    # Code to execute if none of the conditions are True


Example:
x = 10
if x > 15:
    print("x is greater than 15")
elif x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5 but not greater than 15")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 5")



else Statement
The else statement is used to specify a block of code to execute when none of the previous conditions (in the if and elif statements) are True.

if condition:
    # Code to execute if the condition is True
else:
    # Code to execute if the condition is False

Example:
x = 3
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 5")











List:



What is a List?
A list is a fundamental data structure in programming that allows you to store a collection of items. Lists are ordered and can contain elements of various data types,
 such as numbers, strings, and objects.

Creating Lists
You can create a list in various programming languages. In Python, for example, you create a list using square brackets:

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 'apple', 'banana']




Appending to a List
You can add elements to the end of a list using the append() method.

my_list.append(4)  # Adds 4 to the end of the list

Removing from a List
You can remove elements by their value using the remove() method.

my_list.remove('apple')  # Removes 'apple' from the list

Slicing a List
Slicing allows you to create a new list from a subset of the original list.

subset = my_list[1:4]  # Creates a new list with elements at index 1, 2, and 3

Concatenating Lists
You can combine two or more lists to create a new list.

new_list = my_list + [5, 6]  # Concatenates my_list with [5, 6]

Sorting a List
You can sort a list in ascending or descending order using the sort() method.

my_list.sort()  # Sorts the list in ascending order

Checking for an Element
You can check if an element exists in a list using the in keyword.

is_present = 'banana' in my_list  # Checks if 'banana' is in the list (True)










Tuple:



What is a Tuple?
A tuple is a data structure similar to a list, but unlike lists, tuples are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed after creation.
 Tuples are typically used for grouping related data.

Creating Tuples
You can create a tuple in various programming languages. In Python, for example, you create a tuple using parentheses:

my_tuple = (1, 2, 'apple', 'banana')


Accessing Tuple Elements
Tuples are immutable, so you can only access their elements.

second_element = my_tuple[1]  # Access the second element (2)

Tuple Packing and Unpacking
You can pack multiple values into a tuple and unpack them into separate variables.

coordinates = (3, 4)
x, y = coordinates  # Unpack the tuple into x and y (x=3, y=4)

Concatenating Tuples
You can concatenate two or more tuples to create a new tuple.

new_tuple = my_tuple + (3.14, 'cherry')  # Concatenates my_tuple with a new tuple

Checking for an Element
You can check if an element exists in a tuple using the in keyword.

is_present = 'apple' in my_tuple  # Checks if 'apple' is in the tuple (True)

Using Tuples for Multiple Return Values
Tuples are often used to return multiple values from a function.

def get_coordinates():
    return (3, 4)

x, y = get_coordinates()  # Unpack the returned tuple (x=3, y=4)










Differences Between Tuples and Lists
Tuples and lists are both common data structures used in programming, but they have some fundamental differences that make them suitable for different purposes. 
Let's explore these differences:

1. Mutability
List: Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be added, removed, or modified after creation. You can use methods like append(), remove(), and pop() to change
 the contents of a list.

Tuple: Tuples are immutable, and once created, their elements cannot be changed, added, or removed. You can't use methods to modify the tuple.

2. Syntax
List: Lists are created using square brackets [ ]. Elements are separated by commas.

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 'apple', 'banana']
Tuple: Tuples are created using parentheses ( ). Elements are also separated by commas.

my_tuple = (1, 2, 'apple', 'banana')
3. Performance
List: Lists may have slightly slower performance compared to tuples because they are mutable. Modifying a list requires memory reallocation, which can be slower for
 large lists.

Tuple: Tuples have better performance, especially for read-only operations, because of their immutability. They do not require memory reallocation.

4. Use Cases
List: Lists are used when you need a collection of elements that can change, such as a dynamic list of items or data that needs to be modified.

Tuple: Tuples are used when you need an ordered collection of elements that should not change, such as representing a point in 2D space (x, y), or when you want to
 ensure the integrity of the data.





5.Memory Usage
List: Lists generally consume more memory than tuples because they need to store additional information to support their mutability.

Tuple: Tuples consume less memory because they are immutable, and the interpreter can optimize memory usage.












Difference between remove and pop in python



In Python, remove() and pop() are two methods used to manipulate elements in lists. They are used for different purposes and have distinct behaviors:

remove()
Purpose: Removes the first occurrence of a specified value from the list.

Syntax: list.remove(value)

Use:

Removes the specified value from the list if it exists.
If multiple instances of value exist, only the first occurrence from the left side of the list is removed.
Example:

python
Copy code
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]
numbers.remove(2)  # Removes the first occurrence of 2
print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 3, 2, 4]
pop()
Purpose: Removes and returns the element at a specified index.

Syntax: list.pop(index)

Use:

Removes the element at the specified index from the list and returns it.
If index is not provided, by default, pop() removes and returns the last element in the list.
Example:

python
Copy code
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
removed_element = numbers.pop(1)  # Removes element at index 1 (2) and returns it
print(removed_element)  # Output: 2
print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 3, 4]
Key Differences:
Arguments:

remove() takes a value to be removed.
pop() takes an index (optional) indicating the position of the element to be removed.
Return Value:

remove() does not return anything. It modifies the list in place.
pop() returns the removed element. It both modifies the list and provides the removed element.
Usage:

Use remove() when you want to eliminate a specific value from the list without considering its position.
Use pop() when you want to remove an element at a particular index and potentially use the removed value.
Effect:

remove() modifies the list by removing the specified value, but it doesn't alter the list's structure.
pop() modifies the list by removing and returning an element based on the index, potentially changing the list's length.















Loops are a fundamental concept in programming, and they allow you to perform repetitive tasks efficiently. 
In Python, there are two primary types of loops: "for" and "while."

For Loop
The "for" loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) and execute a set of statements for each item in the sequence.
 The loop continues until all items in the sequence have been processed.

Syntax:

for variable in sequence:
    # Code to be executed for each item in the sequence
Example:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)







While Loop
The "while" loop continues to execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. It's often used when you don't know in advance how many times the
 loop should run.

Syntax:

while condition:
    # Code to be executed as long as the condition is true
Example:

count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1







Key Differences:

Control Structure:

for loop iterates over a sequence or iterable.
while loop repeats as long as a specified condition is true.
Use Cases:

Use a for loop when the number of iterations is known or when iterating over a sequence.
Use a while loop when the number of iterations is not known beforehand or when you need to repeatedly execute a block of code until a certain condition is met.
Termination:

for loop terminates when all items in the sequence are processed.
while loop terminates when the specified condition becomes false.







Loop control statements are used to modify the behavior of loops, providing greater control and flexibility during iteration. In Python, two primary loop control
 statements are "break" and "continue."

break Statement
The "break" statement is used to exit the loop prematurely. It can be applied to both "for" and "while" loops, allowing you to terminate the loop when a particular 
condition is met.

Example:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for number in numbers:
    if number == 3:
        break
    print(number)
Output:

1
2
In this example, the loop stops when it encounters the number 3.

continue Statement
The "continue" statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next one. It can be used in both "for" and "while" loops, 
enabling you to bypass certain iterations based on a condition.

Example:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for number in numbers:
    if number == 3:
        continue
    print(number)
Output:

1
2
4
5
In this example, the loop skips the iteration where the number is 3 and continues with the next iteration.












For Loop DevOps use-cases

Server Provisioning and Configuration:

DevOps engineers use "for" loops when provisioning multiple servers or virtual machines with the same configuration. For example, when setting up monitoring agents
 on multiple servers:

servers=("server1" "server2" "server3")
for server in "${servers[@]}"; do
    configure_monitoring_agent "$server"
done

Deploying Configurations to Multiple Environments:

When deploying configurations to different environments (e.g., development, staging, production), DevOps engineers can use a "for" loop to apply the same
 configuration changes to each environment:


environments=("dev" "staging" "prod")
for env in "${environments[@]}"; do
    deploy_configuration "$env"
done

Backup and Restore Operations:

Automating backup and restore operations is a common use case. DevOps engineers can use "for" loops to create backups for multiple databases or services and later
 restore them as needed.

databases=("db1" "db2" "db3")
for db in "${databases[@]}"; do
    create_backup "$db"
done

Log Rotation and Cleanup:

DevOps engineers use "for" loops to manage log files, rotate logs, and clean up older log files to save disk space.

log_files=("app.log" "access.log" "error.log")
for log_file in "${log_files[@]}"; do
    rotate_and_cleanup_logs "$log_file"
done

Monitoring and Reporting:

In scenarios where you need to gather data or perform checks on multiple systems, a "for" loop is handy. For example, monitoring server resources across multiple 
machines:

servers=("server1" "server2" "server3")
for server in "${servers[@]}"; do
    check_resource_utilization "$server"
done


Managing Cloud Resources:

When working with cloud infrastructure, DevOps engineers can use "for" loops to manage resources like virtual machines, databases, and storage across different
 cloud providers.

instances=("instance1" "instance2" "instance3")
for instance in "${instances[@]}"; do
    resize_instance "$instance"
done













While Loop DevOps Usecases
DevOps engineers often use "while" loops in various real-time use cases to automate, monitor, and manage infrastructure and deployments. Here are some practical 
use cases from a DevOps engineer's perspective:

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Pipeline:

DevOps engineers often use "while" loops in CI/CD pipelines to monitor the deployment status of applications. They can create a "while" loop that periodically checks

 the status of a deployment or a rolling update until it completes successfully or fails. For example, waiting for a certain number of pods to be ready in a
 Kubernetes deployment:

while kubectl get deployment/myapp | grep -q 0/1; do
    echo "Waiting for myapp to be ready..."
    sleep 10
done


Provisioning and Scaling Cloud Resources:

When provisioning or scaling cloud resources, DevOps engineers may use "while" loops to wait for the resources to be fully provisioned and ready.
 For instance, waiting for an Amazon EC2 instance to become available:

while ! aws ec2 describe-instance-status --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0 | grep -q "running"; do
    echo "Waiting for the EC2 instance to be running..."
    sleep 10
done


Log Analysis and Alerting:

DevOps engineers can use "while" loops to continuously monitor logs for specific events or errors and trigger alerts when a certain condition is met. 
For example, tailing a log file and alerting when an error is detected:

while true; do
    if tail -n 1 /var/log/app.log | grep -q "ERROR"; then
        send_alert "Error detected in the log."
    fi
    sleep 5
done


Database Replication and Data Synchronization:

DevOps engineers use "while" loops to monitor database replication and ensure data consistency across multiple database instances. The loop can check for
 replication lag and trigger corrective actions when necessary.

while true; do
    replication_lag=$(mysql -e "SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G" | grep "Seconds_Behind_Master" | awk '{print $2}')
    if [ "$replication_lag" -gt 60 ]; then
        trigger_data_sync
    fi
    sleep 60
done


Service Health Monitoring and Auto-Recovery:

DevOps engineers can use "while" loops to continuously check the health of services and automatically trigger recovery actions when services become unhealthy.

while true; do
    if ! check_service_health; then
        restart_service
    fi
    sleep 30
done














In Python, a lambda function is a small anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword. Lambda functions are often used for short-term operations where a 
full function definition would be overly verbose. They are particularly useful in functional programming constructs like map(), filter(), and sorted(). 
Here's an explanation and a real-time example:

Syntax:

python
Copy code
lambda arguments: expression
Example:

python
Copy code
# Regular function
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

# Equivalent lambda function
lambda_add = lambda x, y: x + y

# Using the lambda function
result = lambda_add(3, 5)
print(result)  # Output: 8
In this example:

The regular function add takes two arguments x and y and returns their sum.
The equivalent lambda function lambda_add achieves the same functionality in a more concise way.
The lambda function is then used to add 3 and 5, and the result is printed.
Real-time Example: Using Lambda with map()

python
Copy code
# List of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Using map() with a lambda function to square each number
squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x**2, numbers))

print(squared_numbers)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
In this example:

The map() function applies the lambda function to each element of the numbers list.
The lambda function squares each element (x**2), and the result is a new list of squared numbers.
Lambda functions are valuable in scenarios where a small, simple function is needed for a short duration and defining a full function with def would be unnecessary
 verbosity. They are commonly used in functional programming paradigms and situations where functions are passed as arguments to other functions.





























In Python, decorators are a powerful feature that allows you to modify or extend the behavior of functions or methods. Decorators are applied using the @decorator syntax, and they are often used for tasks such as logging, authentication, memoization, or modifying the output of functions. Here's an explanation and a real-time example:

Basic Syntax:

python
Copy code
@decorator
def some_function():
    # function implementation
Example: Simple Decorator

python
Copy code
# Simple decorator function
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

# Applying the decorator
@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

# Calling the decorated function
say_hello()
Explanation:

my_decorator is a decorator function that takes another function func as an argument.
It defines an inner function wrapper, which is a modified version of the original function.
The modified function is then returned.
Output:

vbnet
Copy code
Something is happening before the function is called.
Hello!
Something is happening after the function is called.
Real-time Example: Logging Decorator

python
Copy code
# Logging decorator
def log_function_call(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Calling function {func.__name__} with arguments {args} and keyword arguments {kwargs}")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"{func.__name__} returned {result}")
        return result
    return wrapper

# Applying the logging decorator
@log_function_call
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

# Calling the decorated function
result = add_numbers(3, 5)
print(f"Result: {result}")
Explanation:

log_function_call is a decorator that logs information about the function call, arguments, and result.
The wrapper function is modified to include logging statements before and after calling the original function.
The decorator is applied to the add_numbers function.
Output:

javascript
Copy code
Calling function add_numbers with arguments (3, 5) and keyword arguments {}
add_numbers returned 8
Result: 8
In this example, the decorator logs information about the function call, making it useful for debugging or monitoring purposes. 
Decorators are versatile and can be customized based on specific needs, making them a powerful tool in Python.






















Python script to list files in folders





import os

def list_files_in_folder(folder_path):
    try:
        # Get the list of files in the specified folder
        files = os.listdir(folder_path)

        if not files:
            print("The folder is empty.")
        else:
            print("Files in the folder:")
            for file in files:
                print(file)

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Folder not found. Please check the folder path.")

# Get folder name from user input
folder_name = input("Enter the folder name: ")

# Construct the full folder path
folder_path = os.path.abspath(folder_name)

# Call the function to list files in the specified folder
list_files_in_folder(folder_path)

The script defines a function list_files_in_folder that takes a folder path as input, lists the files in that folder, and prints their names.

The user is prompted to enter the folder name at runtime using input().

The os.path.abspath() function is used to convert the entered folder name into an absolute path.

The script then calls the list_files_in_folder function with the provided folder path.

If the folder is not found, it handles the FileNotFoundError and prints an appropriate message





__name__ Check:

This conditional statement (if __name__ == "__main__":) ensures that the main() function is executed only if the script is run directly and not imported as a module
 into another script.




















Dictionaries
Overview:
A dictionary in Python is a data structure that allows you to store and retrieve values using keys. It is also known as a hashmap or associative array in other
 programming languages. Dictionaries are implemented as hash tables, providing fast access to values based on their keys.

Creating a Dictionary:
my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}
Accessing Values:
print(my_dict['name'])  # Output: John
Modifying and Adding Elements:
my_dict['age'] = 26  # Modifying a value
my_dict['occupation'] = 'Engineer'  # Adding a new key-value pair
Removing Elements:
del my_dict['city']  # Removing a key-value pair
Checking Key Existence:
if 'age' in my_dict:
    print('Age is present in the dictionary')
Iterating Through Keys and Values:
for key, value in my_dict.items():
    print(key, value)












Sets and Set Operations
Overview:
A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. It is useful for mathematical operations like union, intersection, and difference.

Creating a Set:
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Adding and Removing Elements:
my_set.add(6)  # Adding an element
my_set.remove(3)  # Removing an element
Set Operations:
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}

union_set = set1.union(set2)  # Union of sets
intersection_set = set1.intersection(set2)  # Intersection of sets
difference_set = set1.difference(set2)  # Difference of sets
Subset and Superset:
is_subset = set1.issubset(set2)  # Checking if set1 is a subset of set2
is_superset = set1.issuperset(set2)  # Checking if set1 is a superset of set2





Practice Exercises and Examples
Example: Managing a Dictionary of Server Configurations and Optimizing Retrieval
Scenario:
Suppose you are managing server configurations using a dictionary.

server_config = {
    'server1': {'ip': '192.168.1.1', 'port': 8080, 'status': 'active'},
    'server2': {'ip': '192.168.1.2', 'port': 8000, 'status': 'inactive'},
    'server3': {'ip': '192.168.1.3', 'port': 9000, 'status': 'active'}
}


Function for Retrieval:



def get_server_status(server_name):
    return server_config.get(server_name, {}).get('status', 'Server not found')
Example Usage:
server_name = 'server2'
status = get_server_status(server_name)
print(f"{server_name} status: {status}")

















Lists vs. Sets
Lists
Ordered Collection:

Lists are ordered collections of elements. The order in which elements are added is preserved.
Elements can be accessed by their index.
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(my_list[0])  # Output: 1
Mutable:

Lists are mutable, meaning you can modify their elements after creation.
my_list[1] = 10
Allows Duplicate Elements:

Lists can contain duplicate elements.
my_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]
Use Cases:

Use lists when you need an ordered collection with the ability to modify elements.
Sets
Unordered Collection:

Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. The order in which elements are added is not preserved.
Elements cannot be accessed by their index.
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Mutable:

Sets are mutable, meaning you can add and remove elements after creation.
my_set.add(6)
No Duplicate Elements:

Sets do not allow duplicate elements. If you try to add a duplicate, it won't raise an error, but the set won't change.
my_set = {1, 2, 2, 3, 4}  # Results in {1, 2, 3, 4}
Use Cases:

Use sets when you need an unordered collection of unique elements, and you want to perform set operations like union, intersection, and difference.
Common Operations:
Adding Elements:

Lists use append() or insert() methods.
Sets use add() method.
Removing Elements:

Lists use remove(), pop(), or del statement.
Sets use remove() or discard() methods.
Checking Membership:

Lists use the in operator.
Sets use the in operator as well, which is more efficient for sets.
# Lists
if 3 in my_list:
    print("3 is in the list")

# Sets
if 3 in my_set:
    print("3 is in the set")
Choosing Between Lists and Sets


Use Lists When:

You need to maintain the order of elements.
Duplicate elements are allowed.
You need to access elements by index.


Use Sets When:

Order doesn't matter.
You want to ensure unique elements.
You need to perform set operations like union, intersection, or difference.

        if creator in pr_creators:
            pr_creators[creator] += 1
        else:

#Python program updates a server configuration file by modifying the value associated with a specified key.


def update_server_config(file_path, key, value):
    # Read the existing content of the server configuration file
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()

    # Update the configuration value for the specified key
    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        for line in lines:
            # Check if the line starts with the specified key
            if key in line:
                # Update the line with the new value
                file.write(key + "=" + value + "\n")
            else:

new_value = '600'  # New maximum connections allowed

# Update the server configuration file
update_server_config(server_config_file, key_to_update, new_value)



Explanation:

update_server_config Function:

Takes three parameters: file_path (path to the configuration file), key (the configuration key to be updated), 
and value (the new value to be set for the specified key).

Reads the existing content of the configuration file into the lines list.
Reading and Updating the Configuration File:

Opens the configuration file (file_path) in read mode ('r') to read its existing content.
Iterates through each line in the file.
Checks if the line starts with the specified key.
If it does, the line is updated with the new value and written to the file.
If the line doesn't start with the specified key, it is written to the file as it is.
Example Usage:

Specifies the path to the server configuration file (server_config_file).
Defines the key (key_to_update) and the new value (new_value) for updating the server configuration.
Function Invocation:

Calls the update_server_config function with the specified configuration file path, key, and new value to perform the update.

Flask Web Application:

The program defines a Flask web application (app).
It includes a single route (/createJira) that responds to HTTP POST requests.
Jira API Interaction:

The /createJira route sends a POST request to the Jira REST API endpoint for creating an issue.
It uses basic authentication with an empty username and a Jira API token.
Payload:

The payload for creating a Jira issue is defined in the payload variable.
It includes fields such as description, project key, issue type, and summary.
Response Handling:

The response from the Jira API is returned as a JSON-formatted string with indentation.
Running the Flask App:

If the script is executed directly (__name__ == '__main__'), the Flask app is run on '0.0.0.0' (accessible from outside the local machine) and port 5000.

Iterates through the files in the specified folder, identifying files with modification times older than the threshold date.
delete_files Function:

Takes a list of files (files) as a parameter.
Displays a list of files older than the specified days.
Asks the user for confirmation before proceeding with the deletion.
If the user confirms, it deletes the files; otherwise, it aborts the deletion.
Main Execution:

Takes user input for the folder path and the number of days.
Calls get_files_older_than_days to identify files older than the specified days.
Calls delete_files to handle the deletion process.
